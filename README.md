# Name-Tagger
A name tagger built using a MEMM classifier

## Data

We will be using the corpus from [2003 CoNLL (Conference on Natural Language Learning)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W03-0419.pdf), which uses texts from the Reuters news service. 

The training data has four items per line (tab separated): the token, the part-of-speech, the BIO chunk tag, and the name tag
